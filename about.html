    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Get Outside And Live was an idea born in response to a real safety concern. Jim McCulloch lived outside of Soda
      Springs, Idaho and at certain times of the year when he drove to work there were sections of the road where he was
      completely blinded by the sun. These roads were and still are a popular path for walking, and Jim was always
      worried that he might run into someone's pet or child or somebody. He thought how much safer it would be to have a
      hike and bike path to the side of the road and that idea took root to become a larger vision of connecting the
      county between the cities of Soda Springs, Grace and Bancroft with these hike and bike paths along the highway,
      followed by additional paths in various locations to promote a safer outdoor experience. Jim and his son, Tallan,
      decided to combine this drive to create a safer way of getting outside with their deep love for so many other
      outdoor activities and Get Outside And Live was created as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2024.</p>

    <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
    <p>The primary mission of Get Outside And Live (GOAL) is to promote health and wellness through meaningful programs
      including, but not limited to, engaging in educational outdoor activities that foster a deeper connection with
      nature as well as positive, social connection.</p>

    <p>GOAL's vision includes organizing and executing year-round activities to provide opportunities to get outside,
      enjoy physical activity, and give people the opportunity to connect and build a greater sense of belonging within
      the Caribou County community and beyond.</p>

    <p>Jim envisioned Get Outside And Live as a way to get people out of their homes and
      routines where they are encouraged to try new things as well as connect with others.
      The statistics around loneliness and isolation are alarming, and Jim's hope is to combat
      that with safe, fun opportunities that help everyone experience the joy and beauty of the
      outdoors.</p>
    <p>Jim graduated from Soda Springs High School and later from Colorado School of Mines
      with a degree in Chemical Engineering and has worked at Bayer in Soda Springs since
      2003.</p>
    <p>In his spare time, Jim loves strengthening his marriage, hunting, fishing, horseback
      riding, hiking, and making popcorn for others.</p>
    <p>He lives in Bancroft with his wife, Charlene, and they are blessed to be surrounded by
      their four children and families, including 8 grandchildren.</p>
