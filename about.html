    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Get Outside And Live was an idea born in response to a real safety concern. Jim McCulloch lived outside of Soda
      Springs, Idaho and at certain times of the year when he drove to work there were sections of the road where he was
      completely blinded by the sun. These roads were and still are a popular path for walking, and Jim was always
      worried that he might run into someone's pet or child or somebody. He thought how much safer it would be to have a
      hike and bike path to the side of the road and that idea took root to become a larger vision of connecting the
      county between the cities of Soda Springs, Grace and Bancroft with these hike and bike paths along the highway,
      followed by additional paths in various locations to promote a safer outdoor experience. Jim and his son, Tallan,
      decided to combine this drive to create a safer way of getting outside with their deep love for so many other
      outdoor activities and Get Outside And Live was created as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2024.</p>

    <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
    <p>The primary mission of Get Outside And Live (GOAL) is to promote health and wellness through meaningful programs
      including, but not limited to, engaging in educational outdoor activities that foster a deeper connection with
      nature as well as positive, social connection.</p>

    <p>GOAL's vision includes organizing and executing year-round activities to provide opportunities to get outside,
      enjoy physical activity, and give people the opportunity to connect and build a greater sense of belonging within
      the Caribou County community and beyond.</p>


    <h2>Board and Leadership</h2>
    <p>The board is currently made up of:</p>
    <h3>Jim McCulloch</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>Jim envisioned Get Outside And Live as a way to get people out of their homes and
      routines where they are encouraged to try new things as well as connect with others.
      The statistics around loneliness and isolation are alarming, and Jim's hope is to combat
      that with safe, fun opportunities that help everyone experience the joy and beauty of the
      outdoors.</p>
    <p>Jim graduated from Soda Springs High School and later from Colorado School of Mines
      with a degree in Chemical Engineering and has worked at Bayer in Soda Springs since
      2003.</p>
    <p>In his spare time, Jim loves strengthening his marriage, hunting, fishing, horseback
      riding, hiking, and making popcorn for others.</p>
    <p>He lives in Bancroft with his wife, Charlene, and they are blessed to be surrounded by
      their four children and families, including 8 grandchildren.</p>

    <p>Todd is a Southern California transplant who is learning to appreciate the quieter pace and sense of community of
      living in southeast Idaho. He is excited to support G.O.A.L. and participate in its mission to provide outdoor and
      community opportunities to the Caribou County community.</p>
    <p>Todd graduated in Chemical Engineering from Brigham Young University (Provo) and spent nearly 25 years as an
      environmental engineering consultant based in the Los Angeles area before relocating to Idaho to work for the
      Bayer phosphorus plant in Soda Springs.</p>
    <p>Todd enjoys fishing, reading, and sometimes playing the piano and organ (not very well). He spends a little of
      time and even more money fixing up his imported Japanese SUV—someday it will be worth at least half of what he has
      put into it.</p>
    <p>He lives in Bailey Creek. He has four kids that are grown, and two grandkids that are not.</p>

    <p>Sally Jensen is an exercise and outdoor enthusiast who joined the GOAL board in 2026. She grew up doing all the
      sports, and then was introduced to the great world of outdoor sports when she met her husband in 2011. They have
      five children now and they are doing their best to instill a love of the outdoors in their kids. They love
      mountain biking, hiking, trail running, cycling, rock climbing, and camping together as a family as much as
      possible. Sally also is a certified personal trainer and track and field coach, has a Master's degree in
      biochemistry, and loves jigsaw puzzles. She is honored to be a part of the GOAL mission and to help create
      opportunities for everyone to get outside and enjoy all the benefits that come from being active. </p>
